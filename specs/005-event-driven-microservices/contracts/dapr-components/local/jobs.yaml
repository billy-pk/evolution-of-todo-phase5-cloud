# Note: Dapr Jobs API does NOT use a component
# The Scheduler service uses an embedded etcd database for job storage
# No additional configuration is required - jobs are managed automatically by Dapr
#
# The Scheduler service is part of the Dapr control plane and:
# - Stores all jobs in an embedded etcd instance
# - Requires no additional configuration
# - Jobs survive pod restarts and are executed exactly once
#
# Reference: https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/dapr-services/scheduler/
#
# REMOVED: The invalid 'jobs.postgresql' component
# Reason: jobs.postgresql is not a valid Dapr component type.
# The Scheduler service handles job storage internally.
